# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use Jupyter notebook to help Omar and V. Isualize in creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
### Summary
Omar and V.Isualize have been given a new assignment. We are here to help Omar and V. Isualize by helping them create a ride sharing summary DataFrame that is organized by city type. We will also help them by creating a multiple line chart of total fares for each city type.  

### PyBer Analysis Results

By looking at the information above, you can see that the Urban area has the largest amount of Total Rides, total Drivers and Total Fares. This is due to Urban areas usually being more populated than Rural and Suburban areas. You can see from the information above that the Average Fare per Ride and Driver, is higher in the Rural and Surburban area compared to the Urban area. This is due to Rural and Surburban areas being fairly larger than Urban areas. 

### PyBer Analysis Summary

Moving forward, to avoid any disparities among the city types I suggest we keep in mind,  
 * The population of riders in each area- We have a large amount of rides in Urban areas due to the fact that they are more populated compared to rural and surburban areas. This being said, we could suggest a package or membership to the riders in the Urban area to try to save money while using ride sharing. 
 * The average fares per ride and driver - Rural and Suburban areas tend to be larger and contain more space compared to Urban areas. Due to this the rides are longer and the fares are higher. With this being said, riders are more likely to drive than to use a ride sharing application. By providing bonus for hitting a certain milestone of miles it could increase the amount of riders to use ride sharing. 
 * Possibly suggesting an incentive to drivers to drive more in Rural and Suburban areas. As you can see, the Urban area has more total drivers than it has total rides while the Rural and Suburban is the opposite. We could even this out by providing an incentive to push Urban drivers to Rural and Surburban areas.
